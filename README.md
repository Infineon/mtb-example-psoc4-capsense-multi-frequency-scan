# PSoC&trade; 4: CAPSENSE&trade; multi-frequency scan

This code example demonstrates the use of the multi-frequency scan (MFS) for PSoC&trade; 4 CAPSENSE&trade; applications to prevent false touch detection in the presence of external noise. This code example demonstrates this feature for both CSD (self-capacitance) and CSX (mutual-capacitance) designs.

## Noise injection to test the effectiveness of MFS

This section explains how to inject extreme external noise into the system and shows the effectiveness of MFS in reducing false triggers caused by noise injection.

1. Inject a square wave of 1 MHz (same as the Tx Clock frequency) with an amplitude of 1 V into the system at the Rx pin of Button0 Ganged pin 8.1 in the J4 header for [CY8CKIT-041S-MAX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX) (pin 1.5 in the J1 header for [CY8CKIT-145-40XX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-145-40XX), pin 4.4 in J10 header for [CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S), pin 4.5 in the J2 header for [CY8CKIT-149](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149), and pin 2.5 in the J11 header for [CY8CPROTO-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-040T)) using a function generator as shown in Figure 9 for the [CY8CKIT-041S-MAX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX) device.

      **Figure 9. Test circuit to inject external noise into the system using function generator for [CY8CKIT-041S-MAX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX)**

      ![](images/external-noise.png)
    
    > **Note:** In the [CY8CKIT-041S-MAX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX) kit, the physical GPIO Rx pins for the button widgets are not available on the kit to inject noise. A dummy widget is used to access the GPIO pins available on the board, as shown in Figure 16. Figure 10 shows the scan configuration settings for ganging the Rx pins of the button widgets with the available GPIO pin through the dummy widget.

      **Figure 10. Ganging the Rx pin of button widget with the dummy widget**

      ![](images/ganged-button0-rx.png)
 
      **Figure 11. Using a Dummy widget for ganging purpose**

      ![](images/dummy-scan-config.png)

2. When the MFS feature is not enabled, the Button0 sensor falsely triggers due to the induced noise. This can be seen using CAPSENSE&trade; tuner as shown in Figure 12.You can observe this by the flickering of the corresponding LED in the kit, which indicates a false touch.

      **Figure 12. MFS Disabled: Sensor false triggers due to induced noise**

      ![](images/mfs-disabled-noise.png)

3. Now, MFS is enabled, as shown in Figure 17. The effect of noise on the three different raw counts can be seen using CAPSENSE&trade; tuner, as shown in Figure 13. It is evident that only Channel 0 is affected by the external noise since it is closer to the noise frequency, and the effect of noise on Channel 1 and Channel 2 is minimal because their frequencies differ from the noise frequency.

      **Figure 13. MFS Enabled: Effect of extreme noise on different channels**

      ![](images/mfs-enabled-noise.png)

4. Touch the sensors to see the effectiveness of the MFS feature. It is clearly seen from the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner graph view that there are no false triggers due to the induced noise, as shown in Figure 14. The sensor responds well to finger touch.

      **Figure 14. MFS Enabled: No sensor false triggers due to induced noise**

      ![](images/mfs-enabled-no-sensor-false.png)

5. As shown in Figure 15, channel 1 and channel 2 respond well to touch, and only channel 0 is affected by the induced noise.

      **Figure 15.  No false triggering when MFS is enabled**

## Design and implementation

The CAPSENSE&trade; Peripheral is configured with linear slider widgets and button widgets. This code example uses the CAPSENSE&trade; Sigma-Delta (CSD) sensing method for sliders and the Mutual Capacitive Sensing (CSX) sensing method for buttons. Both mutual and self-capacitance have their own advantages. To understand the detailed comparison between them, refer to the application note, AN85951 – PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; Design Guide. When the CAPSENSE&trade; linear slider is touched, the LEDs turn ON to indicate the position of the touch. When a touch is detected on CAPSENSE&trade; buttons, the corresponding LEDs turn ON.
